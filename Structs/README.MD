# Employee Data Management Program

## Description
Developed a C-language program for managing employee data utilizing structures, demonstrating the ability to store, access, and manipulate data using struct types.
## Key Responsibilities
- **Structure Declaration and Object Handling:**
  - Defined and utilized structures to store employee information including ID, age, and salary.
  - Declared an array of struct objects to manage multiple employees, initializing all elements to zero.

- **Functional Implementation:**
  - Developed functionalities for adding, displaying, updating, and removing employee records.
  - Implemented a menu-driven interface using switch-case constructs for user interaction.
  - Managed dynamic data updates and validation checks to ensure data integrity.

- **Error Handling and User Feedback:**
  - Incorporated error messages and prompts to guide users through invalid inputs and operations.
  - Ensured clear and concise user feedback for successful and unsuccessful operations.

- **Advanced Features:**
  - Expanded the initial program to handle more employees and introduced additional functionalities like updating salaries and removing employee records.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained proficiency in using structures to manage related data in C.
- Developed skills in struct member access and manipulation.
- Enhanced understanding of dynamic data handling using arrays of structs.
- Improved ability to design and implement user-interactive C programs.

## Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Visual Studio for code development and testing

This project demonstrated comprehensive understanding and practical application of structures in C, laying a solid foundation for managing complex data types and enhancing problem-solving skills in software development.
