# Arrays in C 

Developed a user-friendly C-language program to process and manage temperature data using array structures as part of a workshop project.
## Learning Outcomes Achieved
- **Array Data Structures**: Stored data of common types using array structures, efficiently managing temperature data for multiple days.
- **Parallel Arrays**: Associated related data using parallel arrays, ensuring organized and coherent data management.
- **Iteration Constructs**: Processed array elements using iteration constructs, enabling robust data entry and validation from user inputs.

## Key Achievements
- **Error Handling and User Prompts**: Enhanced user experience by incorporating error messages and guiding prompts to ensure valid data entries.
- **Data Analysis**: Extended the program to calculate and display the highest and lowest temperatures along with the specific days they occurred. Computed the mean temperature for any specified period, reinforcing data analysis skills.

This project not only solidified fundamental C programming skills but also emphasized the importance of structured data management and user-centric program design.
