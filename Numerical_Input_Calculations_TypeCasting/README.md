## Numerical Input, Calculations, and Type Casting in C

### Summary
Successfully completed a comprehensive workshop in C programming, focusing on accepting numerical input from users, performing arithmetic calculations, and type casting between different data types. Demonstrated proficiency in coding, compiling, and executing C programs.
### Key Responsibilities and Achievements
- **Variable Declaration:** Mastered the declaration of integral and floating-point variables, ensuring the appropriate data types for different numerical values.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Coded and executed simple calculations using C operators and expressions to perform arithmetic operations on user input.
- **User Input Handling:** Utilized `scanf` to accept numerical values from users, storing these inputs in appropriately typed variables.
- **Type Casting:** Implemented type casting techniques to convert values from one data type to another, facilitating accurate calculations and data manipulation.
- **Real-World Application:** Developed a cash register simulation program that:
  - Accepted an amount to be paid from the user.
  - Calculated and displayed the number of loonies and quarters required.
  - Added GST to the total amount and calculated the required change in various denominations (loonies, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).
- **Output Formatting:** Ensured precise output formatting for financial calculations, including rounding and displaying monetary values to two decimal places.

### Technical Skills Acquired
- Proficiency in C language syntax and semantics.
- Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 for coding and debugging.
- Familiarity with GCC compiler options, including `-Wall` for displaying warnings and `-o` for setting executable names.
- Practical knowledge of integer and floating-point arithmetic, type casting, and the modulus operator for finding remainders.

### Learning Outcomes 
- Gained a deep understanding of the importance of type casting in arithmetic operations to avoid precision errors.
- Recognized the efficiency of using the modulus operator for calculating remainders in financial computations.
