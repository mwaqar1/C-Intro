# Temperature Analyzer in C

## Description:
This project involved developing a C-language program to analyze temperature data logically, consisting of two main parts. The overall project was designed to strengthen skills in creating interactive programs, coding decision-making using selection constructs, implementing repetitive logic with iteration constructs, and nesting logical blocks.

## Responsibilities:
- **Interactive Program Development:** Developed an interactive program to prompt the user for high and low temperature values over a specified number of days.
- **Data Validation:** Implemented nested loops to ensure temperature values fell within a valid range (-40 to 40 degrees) and that the high temperature was greater than the low temperature.
- **Statistical Calculations:** Calculated and displayed the average, highest, and lowest temperatures over a four-day period, including the day each extreme temperature occurred.
- **Code Documentation:** Ensured all code files included necessary documentation such as full name, student number, email address, and section.
- **Reflection and Reporting:** Wrote a detailed reflection on the learning outcomes and the development process, including the use of pseudo-coding, iteration constructs, and debugging methods.

## Learning Outcomes:
- **Logical Data Analysis:** Gained proficiency in using loops and conditional statements to validate and process user input.
- **Temperature Statistics Calculation:** Developed skills in computing averages and identifying extreme values within a dataset.
- **Code Quality and Documentation:** Improved code readability and maintenance through thorough documentation and structured coding practices.
- **Problem-Solving and Debugging:** Enhanced problem-solving skills by debugging and testing the program to ensure accuracy and robustness.

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of logical data analysis and interactive program development in C, reinforcing fundamental programming concepts and techniques.
